        <p class="text-drop_down font-serif leading-8">
          To you, I'm a futurist, a classically trained biotechnologist , self-taught programmer and tinkerer. I’ve worked in academia and industry as a synthetic biologist.

        <p class="text-drop_down font-serif leading-8">
          This is my personal webspace where I’ll post my hot takes, goals and progress. It will also temporarily host my bioreactor platform.

        <h2 class="text-[200%] text-italic_sub">What am I currently working on?</h2>
        <p class="text-drop_down font-serif leading-8">
          I am currently undertaking a self-directed master of research from which will form the basis of my startup in biodegradable thermoplastics. Alongside this, I’m developing a line of my own affordable desktop bioreactors and a brand to go with it.

      <div class="pb-10">
        <h2 class="text-[200%] text-italic_sub">What do I actually enjoy doing?</h2>
        <p class="text-drop_down font-serif leading-8">
          I mainly enjoy surfing, skating, freediving and camping when I can. On the nerd out side I also enjoy strategy games like the Total War series and Starcraft II. I also own an Elegoo Saturn 2 that I use for printing Warhammer proxies (40K, EPIC 40K, and Battlefleet Gothic), which I mainly enjoy painting.

        <h2 class="text-[200%] text-italic_sub">What motivates me?</h2>
        <p class="text-drop_down font-serif leading-8">
          I developed a Jungian hero archetype very early in life which hasn't yet left me, and has manifested within my love of the natural world. So all things environmental.
