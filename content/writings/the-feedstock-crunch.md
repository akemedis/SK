The increasing demand for polymers worldwide has contributed markedly to the unprecedented strain of civilization on the natural environment. Plastics make up 4.5% of global GHG emissions and are expected to consume 20% of global petroleum production and 15% of the global annual carbon budget by 2050 (World Economic Forum 2023). Recycling is not solving this issue, only 16% of plastic production is predicted to be recycled globally by 2060, with plastic recycling rates in the US having declined from 9.5% to 5% between 2014 and 2016 due to decreasing costs for plastic resin and concerns around toxicity of recycled plastic products (Greenpeace 2022, World Economic Forum 2023). Biodegradable plastics are a viable solution, however less than 1% of plastics produced globally are considered bioplastics, with less than 0.25% considered home compostable (European Bioplastics 2023). When comparing the performance of home-compostable plastics to conventional plastics, it is evident that there exists a significant disparity in areas such as mechanical strength, toughness, optical transparency, water resistance, and gas barrier properties (Khatami, Perez-Zabaleta et al. 2021). In addition, current home-compostable plastics are more expensive than conventional plastics, offer comparable if not worse soil and water toxicity, and possess poor to questionable biodegradability under natural conditions (Bagheri, Laforsch et al. 2017, Shruti and Kutralam-Muniasamy 2019, Zimmermann, Dombrowski et al. 2020, Di Bartolo, Infurna et al. 2021, Brown, Chadwick et al. 2023, Celletti, Fedeli et al. 2023). Therefore, there exists a severe global necessity for the rapid development and commercialization of economical, high performance, and truly ecofriendly polymers.

Poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid (PLGA) is a promising and overlooked thermoplastic that possesses exceptional biodegradability and gas barrier properties, alongside excellent thermomechanical properties that take the best from polyglycolic acid and polylactic acid (Murcia Valderrama, van Putten et al. 2020, Samantaray, Little et al. 2020, Wang, Murcia Valderrama et al. 2022). PLGA is a highly tunable copolymer with regards to its tensile strength, elasticity, gas barrier properties, and biodegradability. These properties can be tuned by dynamic regulation of the monomer pathways that modulate the composition of glycolate-glycolate (G-G), glycolate-lactate (G-L), and lactate-lactate (L-L) ester bonds within the PLGA copolymer. G-G ester bonds are mechanically strong, stiff, and easily hydrolysable in comparison to L-L ester bonds that possess less strength and biodegradability, but are more elastic, whilst G-L bonds strike a balance between the two (Washington, Swiner et al. 2017, Murcia Valderrama, van Putten et al. 2020). Further regarding ecotoxicity, the fundamental monomers and oligomers comprising PLGA have been demonstrated either inert or positively correlated to plant growth in several plant species in a concentration dependant manner (Kinnersley, Scott et al. 1990, Kinnersley 1993, Abbasi, Lazarovits et al. 2009). PLGA is currently used in the biomedical industry where it is synthesized through a costly and risky ring opening polymerisation (ROP) process using metal catalysts with high-energy inputs (Gentile, Chiono et al. 2014, Pardeshi, Nikam et al. 2023). Fortunately, PLGA has been biosynthesised in E. coli with some success regarding its molecular weight and thermal properties. However, the PLGA films mechanical properties were not tested, and the yields within the chassis were not techno economically appropriate to produce commodity plastics.
